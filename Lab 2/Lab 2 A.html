    <h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
    <hr>

       <p> Paragraph element. This is a paragraph. Open and closed by <i>paragraph tags</i>. Above and below are heading tags of all types (h1-h6). 
            This paragraph will be under heading one only. I also added a <i>horizontal rule tag</i> under heading 1, in order to underline it. <br> Inserted right before this line is a break element. It should introduce 
            a break into the paragraph, eventhough in the code all this text is written as one paragraph. I also used the i tag to italisize the different 
            tags mentioned in this paragraph.</p>

    <blockquote>
        This text is inserted between blockquote opening and closing tags. It is meant to surround text you want to <strong>emphasize</strong>. It is meant for
        SEO use (I think) and for screen readers, etc. I also bolded the word emphasize with the strong tag which bolds the text AND adds emphasis.

    <h2>Sample Description List</h2>
    <hr>
        <dl>
        <dt> Description List</dt> 
            <dd> I started a descriptiove list with the tag dl. Above I used the tag dt to add the first term in the list - "description list" which is what this tag makes. Then I used the dd tag
                for this block of text to add the definition/descripion of the term above. </dd> 
        <dt> Second term </dt>
            <dd> Above is the second term in the list, again surrounded by an open and closing dt tag. This definition is surrounded by open and closing dd tags. Below I will add a real example using these tags. </dd>
        <dt> IP </dt>
            <dd> Internet Protocol: the method by which data is sent from one computer to another on the Internet. Computers have addresses, called IP addresses, which is used to identify which
                computer to send data to. </dd>
        </dl>

    <h3>Special Entity Characters</h3>
    <hr>
        <p><small>Copyright &copy; Adding copyright symbol in new paragraph, used small tag to make text small (don't forget closing tag). &nbsp I added a blank space right before this.</small></p>

    <h4>Adding a Structural Element</h4>
    <hr>
        <div>
            <strong> This is a structural element defined by the div tag. I also used the strong tag to emphasize it. The point of div tags is to create a block with space above and below (to emphasize text).</strong>
        </div> 

    <h5><b>Anchor Element</b></h5>
    <hr>
        <a href="http://www.google.ca"> An anchor element using a tag and href attribute. Links to a website. (This is under heading h5 which is small so I bolded it).</a>
